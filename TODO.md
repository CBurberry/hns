# Ideas
Disabling Moth FX is not saved? It was reported to be bad even after death. But the code seems to be okay.
Add effects to the object?
On Favela, Tombstones are not visible from distance
Stat protect: Store the stats in 1.7a servers
Strange bug: If more last hiders die in the same time, then the next seeker will be a random player out of the seekers
Since setXYOrigin function works, add models with fucked up X/Y origins, and maybe lean objects, like barrel, chair, etc
Player of the week/match (best hider, best seeker, most VPs, ...)
New scoreboard. Team separating is unrequired, HNS is usually about personal performance
New attachments: Maybe ability to define them with functions (No attachment image will be compulsory)
Stock positioning, like in modern games: outline of object where u can place, and press a button to place there, like onto a table etc (Seems really complex).
Solid objects when fixed, with trigger_radius
Final killcam
Cheat protection (do not use playermodel, or idk...)
There is a visible tag under hiders, should be hidden somehow
Multilingual print when trying to login as an admin, if it was successful or not
Seeking time is not optimal. Maybe until an amount of players if should be increased as it is now, and after that decreased
Materials of waypoints are still foggy (Disable receiving shadows, etc in material?)
Ability to save the default language in stats (But don't force it)
If the only one seeker leave, we should choose a player with big level to be the seeker; it is already coded, but doesn't seem to work
Crowded air function seems to be totally unfunctional. But it also seems to be unnecessary, those parts can be commented out
If settings are changed (model/FX/weapon/etc), maybe we could change it immediately instead of the next spawn
New sounds after the map is over
Challenge tiers (Ninja I, Ninja II, etc)
Somehow display the axis while rotating the object (for example with an FX)
Ability to define the vote map count (vote_mapcount)
Moth fx selector

2.5. Press [USE] to pass through (2) - now when crossing to the new area with F it triger the teleport, and we lost it, can you make BIND key like switching object? let's say "openScriptMenu ingame teleport"?
5. lvl 111 and above - On that lvl seeker have the ability to shot through wall, infact its not like this, because any lower lvl then 111 can kill hider throw wall if this hider is not lvl 111, so its not true, the ability to shot throw wall is for everyone.
7. openScriptMenu ingame choose - as i checked in the new version its not working, regarding this, it is possible to bind specific object to key? so lets say i want to bind F1 to mattress F2 to sign etc.. something like /bind F1 "openScriptMenu ingame select mattress" so we can swith objects that fast. (jelenleg minden mapon külön ID-ket kéne ehhez bindelni a model menühöz, esetleg egy saját parancsot csinálhatunk ahová modelt lehetne bindelni, pl com_mattress, bár az sem lesz tökéletes mattress selector, mert több féle van, és a playerek nem is tudnák a model neveket... legfeljebb adhatunk ezeknek saját neveket egy tömbben, pl mattress, box1, box2, és ezekre lehetne bindelni)
9. spectators off - it is possible to give every player switch on\off setting so he can choose if someone can spactate him while he is seeker? maybe you can trick it with the black screen like u did on currapted stat. the idea that pro players may revel pro spots to other players if toshe players spctate them, if possibole to add a swith will be greet! (Nem tudjuk eldönteni épp kit spectatelünk :/)
